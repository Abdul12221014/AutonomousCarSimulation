# Autonomous Driving Simulation with Deep Q-Learning
This project simulates an autonomous driving environment using Pygame and trains a reinforcement learning agent via Deep Q-Learning. The simulation features a car navigating a road filled with obstacles, aiming to avoid collisions while maximizing rewards. The agent learns from its environment using a neural network to predict Q-values for state-action pairs. Key features include dynamic obstacle generation, a responsive reward system, and a neural network for decision-making. This project serves as an excellent introduction to reinforcement learning in gaming and autonomous systems, offering insights into agent-environment interaction and deep learning integration. ðŸš—ðŸ’»âœ¨
